        <div class="subheading mb-5">Business AdministrationðŸ“š</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">Second-year Pre-Business student at the University of California, Riverside in the College of Humanities, Arts, and Social Sciences. I am currently pursuing a major in Business Administration with a concentration in Information Systems. My goal is to gain experience in the field of finances and the business world with the ultimate objective of opening a personal business. I am also a first-generation college student, and see in education the power to improve the future of my family and my community. During my first two years at UC Riverside I have worked towards professional success, but also to encourage other students to pursue their goals and see in education a path for their future. For the last ten years I have lived in the state of California and took the opportunity to become part of the Southern California community, and now of the student community at UC Riverside.<br><br>

         As part of my community in the city of Hemet, California I have participated in local community events and student tutoring organizations. For instance, my main community service contribution prior to the transition into online learning was tutoring at Hyatt Elementary School through the ASES program. During my time at Hyatt Elementary I helped students from first grade to fifth grade complete homework assignments, and collaborated with ASES program coordinators to help organize school festivals and other events. At the same time, I participated in local high school football games at San Jacinto High School by serving as part of the concession team. However, now during my time at UC Riverside I have become part of the Chicano Student Center with the intention of creating a positive impact among the Chicano student community. Certainly, obtaining professional experience in the field of Business is crucial for the success of my career; therefore, at UC Riverside I have become involved in the Latino Business Student Association. The LBSA organization has been a source of new opportunity in which I am able to develop professional, social, and entrepreneurial skills.<br><br>
        
        My interest in the Business field was influenced by my goal of improving the future of my family, and the dream of becoming a source of inspiration for other Hispanic or Latino students. Overall, my dream is to open a personal business through which I am able to build a stable lifestyle for my family, but also become a source of employment for my community. Nonetheless, to achieve this my first object is to graduate with a Bachelors of Business from the University of California, Riverside, and obtain professional and entrepreneurial experience. However, on a personal level my favorite hobbies are equestrian events and horseback riding, as well as anything that involves being outside and enjoying the beauty of nature, and spending time with family and friends. At the same time, I enjoy watching soccer games and being part of small sport family competitions. Indeed, the pandemic has created an impact in both my professional and personal life, but I am determined to make the best out of these hard times and continue to search for professional growth opportunities.
